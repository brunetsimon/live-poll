## What are we building?
We are building an app where users can give feedback to a question and the aggregated result will be displayed on a graph.  

## What are the requirements?
* The user shall be able to select a poll using a poll ID. 
* The user shall be able to vote for that specific poll ID.
* The user shall have 4 options to vote which corresponds to feelings from “Love” to “Hate”.
* The meeting organizer shall be able to select a poll using a poll ID.
* A graph showing the current poll result shall be displayed to the meeting organizer.
* The graph shall show “live” results and have one row/column for each feelings.

## What language is used to build the app?
To allow the app to run across multiple device we will use a [“Progressive Web App” instead of a “Native App”](https://medium.com/one-more-thing-studio/native-react-native-or-pwa-what-should-i-choose-e63f18732b5e). 
This means that the app is nothing more than a website which can be access by an URL.

Like any other websites, the app will be built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
But to make it feel more like a “real app” (no page reload, …) we will be using the Javascript library [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) develop by Facebook.
To save us lot of time we will also use a CSS library [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) which provides already made component to make our app look good.
